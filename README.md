# Pixel Fonts
These are pixel art fonts I have created for a variety of purposes.

Files:
- .c files: These are the C array output from Piskel that is converted by the [piskelc2svg.py script](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/script-dump/blob/main/converters/piskelc2svg.py)
- .svg files: These are the SVG representaion of each glyph
- .sfd files: These files are the FontForge save used for putting together the font

## Icons-16x16
Icons-16x16 is a collection of 16x16 pixel art icons

## Icons-12x12
Icons-12x12 is a collection of 12x12 pixel art icons

## Pixel-7x7
Pixel-7x7, inspired by the UI font used in the game *Minecraft* and some fonts used for Flipper Zero tools. It is used on my website for very small text while formats for embedded devices such as [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/) are planned.

### Monospace
The Monospace version of Pixel-7x7 is the same as Condensed though with a few characters modified and all of the glyphs were set to the same width.

- 5x9 grid including descent

### True Monospace
This version is similar to the Monospace font but is always within the 5x7 grid.

## Pixel-9x9
Pixel-9x9 was made in an attempt to make a slightly larger font for use on the website.

### Supercondensed
This font is basically the condensed version of Pixel-7x7 but nine pixels tall (excluding descent).

- 5x9 grid, 5x13 grid with descent

## Pixel-12x12
This font was somewhat inspired by VCR OSD Mono that is recently known for its use in the game *ULTRAKILL*. It was also somewhat inspired by fonts used by Flipper Devices.

### Condensed
This font finds the most use on my website.

- 8x16 grid including descent

## Pixel-14x14
This font was created to have a font that is slightly larger than the Pixel-12x12 font. It takes more inspiration from the VCR OSD Mono font already mentioned.

### Condensed

- 10x18 grid including descent

### True Monospace
Also known as "ULTRACOMPUTER". This font sticks to the 10x14 grid and is more like the VCR OSD Mono font.

- 10x14 grid

## Pixel-17x17
This font is once again made for having larger text.

### Condensed
- 13x23 grid including descent
