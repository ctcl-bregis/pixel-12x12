# Pixel Fonts
These are pixel art fonts I have created for a variety of purposes.

Files:
- .c files: These are the C array output from Piskel that is converted by the [piskelc2svg.py script](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/script-dump/blob/main/converters/piskelc2svg.py)
- .svg files: These are the SVG representaion of each glyph
- .sfd files: These files are the FontForge save used for putting together the font
